# Questo

Questo is a platform that allows you to take practice quizzes on the go!

## Tech Stack

Questo uses a node.js backend with mongoDB atlas, and a vue.js frontend (with some parts written in vanilla JS). Electron is also used to wrap the project into a desktop app, but it is not needed for the project to run. 

Results from your quizzes are stored on the cloud and sync across your devices
